## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Machine Learning project completed during my internship at **[Company Name]** in 2024. The project focused on image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The goal was to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images into one of two categories: "cat" or "dog."

## Tech Stack

The project was developed using the following technologies and tools:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, visualization, and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **OpenCV/Pillow**: For image preprocessing and augmentation (optional, if used).
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consisted of labeled images of cats and dogs, which were split into training and validation sets. The images were preprocessed to standardize their size and format, and various data augmentation techniques (such as rotation, flipping, and zooming) were applied to increase the robustness of the model.

## Modeling

The modeling process involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation.
2. **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected dense layers for classification.
3. **Training**: The model was trained using the training dataset with categorical crossentropy as the loss function and accuracy as the evaluation metric. The Adam optimizer was used to adjust the learning rate.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated on the validation dataset, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were calculated.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy, e.g., "95%"] on the validation set. The model effectively learned to differentiate between images of cats and dogs, with the most significant improvements coming from data augmentation and fine-tuning
