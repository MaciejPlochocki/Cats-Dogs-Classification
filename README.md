**Cats and Dogs classification**
**Project Overview**
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Machine Learning project completed during my internship  in 2024. The project focused on image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The goal was to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images into one of two categories: "cat" or "dog."

**Tech Stack**
The project was developed using the following technologies and tools:

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration, visualization, and model development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
OpenCV/Pillow: For image preprocessing and augmentation (optional, if used).
Git: For version control and collaboration.

**Data**
The dataset used in this project consisted of labeled images of cats and dogs, which were split into training and validation sets. The images were preprocessed to standardize their size and format, and various data augmentation techniques (such as rotation, flipping, and zooming) were applied to increase the robustness of the model.
